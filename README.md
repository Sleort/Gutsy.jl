> [!WARNING]
> This package is **experimental** *and* **under development**. Expect functionality to not work perfectly (or at all) - contact me if you need help, have wishes/suggestions etc.

## Installation
In the Julia terminal ("REPL" - Read Eval Print Loop), type `]` to get to `pkg` ("package") mode. Then add this repository like this: 
```
julia> # type `]` 

pgk> add https://github.com/Sleort/Gutsy.jl
```
(If it ever evolves to becoming a registered package, you may get away with just `add Gutsy`. But that is currently not the case.)
